### Description:
This project aims to offer users a comprehensive tool for tracking and assessing the performance of their LinkedIn posts. By utilizing this project, individuals can obtain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their content strategy and pinpoint areas for enhancement. One of the core functionalities of this project is to monitor the performance of LinkedIn posts over a specified time frame. Users can specify a time range, and the project will generate a detailed report detailing the engagement levels and impressions their posts received during that period. Moreover, the project evaluates the engagement levels of each post, factoring in metrics like likes, comments, shares, and other interactions. This analysis assists users in identifying which posts were most successful in engaging their audience and which ones may require improvement. Furthermore, the project calculates the percentage of engagement per impression, offering users a clear understanding of how effectively their content reaches and engages their intended audience.
